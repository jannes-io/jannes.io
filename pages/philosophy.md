# Course Philosophy

Our courses are set up to point you through a logical order of learning.
We always advise checking out the first party sources that are linked throughout the course.
The job of a course is to give a general outline and direction of where to go.

## Goal of our courses

After being in the software development community for a long time, and being a part of many experiences we realised that
first party manuals are often too in-depth for a newcomer to understand. Take for example the PHP manual.
Their "getting started - a basic tutorial" instantly dives into superglobals, if statements,...
These are things that someone who has experience in other languages would understand, but someone who's only experienced basic HTML and CSS will instantly feel lost.

Our courses are not meant to make you an expert in any means.
We aim to hold your hand through the learning process and give you all the puzzle pieces, but assembling the puzzle is up to you.

Software development is a skill, there will not be any course or education that will somehow make you a master.
And if any course claims it will, they're full of shit and probably just after your money.
The only way to grow as a developer is to simply get out there and do it.
Experience different projects and build applications. Every time you make a project, you will come across different challenges and hurdles.
Every time you solve one of those challenges, you will be enriched and can look back at the solution when you encounter it again.

Software development is often classified as a knowledge-based skill, where you need to *know* the syntax, you need to *know* the standard library,... .
While this is true to a certain extent, just knowing the standard library of a language by heart will not make you a good developer.
Let's compare programming to art. Knowing how to draw a line does not translate into a good piece of art.
However, drawing hundreds of different trees will make you substantially better at drawing trees.
The same is true for programming. Software development is a transferable/functional skill.
The most important part of development is problem-solving. The only way to get better at it is to solve many problems.
Likewise for programming languages, once you master one language, it's really easy to transfer it to other languages.

So bottom line is, we attempt to teach you the syntax, best practices,... We try to follow the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
by teaching you the 20% that will cover 80% of use-cases. But after that, it's up to you to develop your own skill by taking on little projects and challenges.
Once you are at least somewhat comfortable in development, we highly suggest you use first party manuals for information.

## Issues with formal education in web space

Time and time again we see fresh graduates trying to enter the sector. And time and time again we see them fail a basic technical test.
Why is that? We can only speculate... . Surely someone who dedicated 3 years of their live full-time learning software development should do better?
Formal education gives a false promise of knowledge. The web's evolution is too fast for formal education to keep up.
When changing a course in formal education, it must go through so many hoops and approvals that by the time it gets into the hands of teachers, it's already outdated.

And when it does come into the hands of teachers, they need to go and research to get a better understanding of the topic.
It's not uncommon for motivated students to outpace their teachers. Additionally, there are only 2 types of software development teachers.
Those who just have a passion for teaching, and those who failed in the development industry and decided to become a teacher instead.
If you're lucky you'll get the former, they're actually doing their best to provide you with knowledge.
Teachers are simply not paid competitively compared to the industry they're teaching about.
A good junior full-stack developer can already out-earn the best college teacher.

Our courses are written by current senior software developers and lead developers that are employed in the industry.
We try to prioritise that what actually matters when dealing with scalable and maintainable production codebases.
We know the struggles and hurdles of actual software devs unlike formal educators who have never even seen what a large scale production application looks like.
They're not at fault for this though. Again it comes back to previously mentioned issues.
We are the opposite of formal educators. We are in the software development industry, but we have a passion for teaching and spreading knowledge.

## Issues with courses and tutorials

Tutorials are simply not helpful and do not teach you anything.
Say you follow a tutorial on creating a contact form, and you're encouraged to copy/paste all the code, then you've not learnt a single thing.
We provide code examples but will never claim an example is the right solution for your use-case.
Additionally, we go step by step over each line, sometimes even word for word, in our examples to give you an understanding of what's going on.
But at the end of the day, our courses will suffer from the same issues. We can only do so much to get you started, actually becoming a good developer is completely up to you.

Software development is not "plug and play". The memes you see about copying stack overflow code are simply not true.
It may work for amateur projects, but any copy/pasted code will quickly be identified and shot down once you get into the industry.
**Copy/Pasting is a terrible practice. You won't learn anything and despite that it may work, it's almost never the right solution to the problem you're facing.**

Finally, a lot of courses tackle programming as if it is just knowledge. It's not. Software development is much more comparable to art.
In art there are countless ways to express a feeling or convey a message. The same is true for programming. 
There are a million ways to go from input to expected output. There is a lot of room for interpretation, creative problem-solving, code formatting & style, ...
Only practice makes perfect, no painter started with a rendition of the Mona Lisa, no sculptor started with the statue of David. Only hard work and dedication
to the craft can make you an expert.

## Free knowledge

Since we are employed in the industry, our goal is not to collect revenue, if anything this project and our courses run on a net loss due to the time it takes to write as well as hosting costs.
We will never place any paywall on our website or restrict access to "premium users".
In the future if we see our courses are popular, we may add exams or certifications which would be pay to participate to recuperate some cost, but all the information remains completely free of charge.

We are big advocates for open-source/open-core projects. They are quite literally the pillars to many production applications.
Following that same principle, we hope to inspire many others with our courses and philosophy. Collectively we may be able to change the industry and make it more welcoming to new aspiring developers.
Even if we can just get a handful of people started on their journey, that's enough for us.
