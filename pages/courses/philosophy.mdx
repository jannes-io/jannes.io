# Course Philosophy

Our courses are set up to point you through a logical order of learning.
We always advise checking out the first party sources that are linked throughout the course.
The job of a course is to give a general outline and direction of where to go.

## Goal of our courses

After being in the software development community for a long time, and being a part of many experiences we realised that
first party manuals are often too in-depth for a newcomer to understand. Take for example the PHP manual.
Their "getting started - a basic tutorial" instantly dives into superglobals, if statements,...
These are things that someone who has experience in other languages would understand, but someone who's only experienced basic HTML and CSS will instantly feel lost.

Our courses are not meant to make you an expert in any means.
We aim to hold your hand through the learning process and give you all the puzzle pieces, but assembling the puzzle is up to you.
The only way to grow as a developer is to simply get out there and do it.
Experience different projects and build applications. Every time you make a project, you will come across different challenges and hurdles.
Every time you solve one of those challenges, you will be enriched and can look back at the solution when you encounter it again.

Software development is often classified as a knowledge-based skill, where you need to *know* the syntax, you need to *know* the standard library,... .
While this is true to a certain extent, just knowing the standard library of a language by heart will not make you a good developer.
Let's compare programming to art. Knowing how to draw a line does not translate into a good piece of art.
However, drawing hundreds of different trees will make you substantially better at drawing trees.
The same is true for programming. Software development is a transferable/functional skill.
The most important part of development is problem-solving. The only way to get better at it is to solve many problems.
Likewise for programming languages, once you master one language, it's really easy to transfer it to other languages.

So bottom line is, we attempt to teach you the syntax, best practices,... We try to follow the <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</Link>
by teaching you the 20% that will cover 80% of use-cases. But after that, it's up to you to develop your own skill by taking on little projects and challenges.
Once you are at least somewhat comfortable in development, we highly suggest you use first party manuals for information.

## Free knowledge

Since we are employed in the industry, our goal is not to collect revenue, if anything this project and our courses run on a net loss due to the time it takes to write as well as hosting costs.
We will never place any paywall on our website or restrict access to "premium users".
In the future if we see our courses are popular, we may add exams or certifications which would be pay to participate to recuperate some cost, but all the information remains completely free of charge.

We are big advocates for open-source/open-core projects. They are quite literally the pillars to many production applications.
Following that same principle, we hope to inspire many others with our courses and philosophy. Collectively we may be able to change the industry and make it more welcoming to new aspiring developers.
Even if we can just get a handful of people started on their journey, that's enough for us.
