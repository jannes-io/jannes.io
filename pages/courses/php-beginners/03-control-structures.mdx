# Control Structures

Imagine control structures as train tracks. There's different junctions, turntables, loops, stations,... which all form the "train network".
Similarly, control structures in programming dictate the flow of our application.

## If/Else

If/Else, or going back to our train analogy, they are the junctions in our code. Let's look at a simple if statement.
Go ahead and adapt your code in `src/index.php` to match the following code and refresh your page.

```php
<?php
$condition = true;
if ($condition) {
    echo 'I am true';
} elseif ($condition === 0) {
    echo 'I am zero';
} else {
    echo 'I am false';
}
```

Now let's dissect this further.

```php
if
```

This starts off an if statement.

```php
$condition
```

The expression that needs to be evaluated. Always surrounded in parentheses.

```php
{
    echo 'I am true';
}
```

The code block that is executed if `$condition` evaluates to `true`.

```php
} elseif ($condition === 0) {
    echo 'I am zero';
}
```

An optional additional if, in this case we check if `$condition` is identical to `0`. You can add as many `elseif` sections as you need.
Try changing `$condition = true;` to `$condition = 0;` and you will see `'I am zero'` on your page.

```php
} else {
    echo 'I am false';
}
```

The else part is also optional and is only executed when no previous `if (...)` is executed.
Go ahead and change the value in `$condition` to `false`, and you will see the result on your page.

The `if`, `elseif`, `else` will always be evaluated top to bottom, and as soon as one of the expressions is found to be true, it will execute the code and then exit the entire `if` structure.

### Comparison Operators

You can also use the Comparison Operators to create an expression that can be evaluated to a boolean. All Comparison Operators result in a boolean value.
A list of available operators can be found <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php">in the PHP manual</Link>.

It is important to note the difference between two variables being **equal** and **identical**.
Equality checks are also called "loose comparisons", since it does not take type into consideration.
Identical checks are also nicknamed "strict comparison", as the name suggests, it not only compares values but also types.
Usually using loose comparisons (`==`) instead of strict comparisons (`===`) is considered bad practice.
Variables of different types should not be compared with each other.
If you know that you have to compare 2 variables of different types, say a string and an integer, you always want to cast them to the same type first.

Example of strict comparison between a string and an integer:

```php
<?php
$myString = '10';
$myInteger = 10;

if ($myString === $myInteger) {
    echo 'Impossible!';
}

if ((int)$myString === $myInteger) {
    echo 'Correct.';
}
```

### Logical Operators

Conditions can be strung together with Logical Operators. The list of available Logical Operators are also viewable <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php">in the PHP manual</Link>.

Note here that `and`, `or` and `xor` operators, while still valid syntax, are not used anymore in modern PHP and most code style guides will advise against using them.

<Exercise title="Create an expression with $a, $b and $c that evaluates to true if $a is greater or equals to $b, and $c is identical to 10.">
  <pre>
    <code className="language-php">
      &#60;?php
      $a = 1;
      $b = 0;
      $c = 10;
      echo $a >= $b && $c === 10;
    </code>
  </pre>
</Exercise>

### What is true?

So far we've been talking about "evaluates to true/false", and we've been using a boolean value (`true` or `false`) in `$condition`.
In reality, anything can be evaluated as a boolean value. For example, let's change `$condition` to hold an integer of value `0` and then see what happens.

```php
<?php
$condition = 0;
if ($condition) {
    echo 'I am true';
} else {
    echo 'I am false';
}
```

It prints "I am false"? All data types that we've seen in the previous chapter can be used as an expression.
The action of "evaluating as a boolean value" is also called "type casting to boolean", we already briefly talked about type casting in the previous chapter.
Internally PHP attempts to cast the given value to a boolean. These are some examples that clarify the "rules" in play during this conversion.

Strings:
* `"hello"` => true
* `""` => false

Integers:
* `1` => true
* `-1` => true
* `0` => false

Floats:
* `0.1` => true
* `-33.33` => true
* `0` => false

Arrays:
* `['hello']` => true
* `[]` => false

Objects:
* always true

Null:
* always false

To get an extensive overview of all different data types and how they evaluate to booleans, you can reference the <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php">PHP manual</Link>.

<Exercise title="Try to set $condition to different values to experiment with type evaluation to boolean." />

## Switch

You can imagine that in some cases you'd want to check a variable for many values and do something different depending on said value.
Let's look at an example using `if` statements.

```php
<?php
$state = 'pending_payment';
if ($state == 'pending_payment') {
    echo 'You still need to pay';
} elseif ($state == 'processing') {
    echo 'Your order is being processed';
} elseif ($state == 'pending_shipment') {
    echo 'Your order is on its way!';
} elseif ($state == 'shipped') {
    echo 'Your order has been shipped.';
} else {
    echo 'Oops! Seems like we\'ve lost your order';
}
```

You can see how this can get very convoluted and hard to read. This is where a `switch` statement would come in handy. So let's rewrite this if statement using a `switch`.

```php
<?php
$state = 'pending_payment';
switch ($state) {
    case 'pending_payment':
        echo 'You still need to pay';
        break;
    case 'processing':
        echo 'Your order is being processed';
        break;
    case 'pending_shipment':
        echo 'Your order is on its way!';
        break;
    case 'shipped':
        echo 'Your order has been shipped.';
        break;
    default:
        echo 'Oops! Seems like we\'ve lost your order';
}
```

This may be a lot to take in at once, so let's dive in piece by piece.

```php
switch ($state)
```

This states that we want to have a `switch` statement with `$state` as the subject.

```php
case 'pending_payment':
```

The `case` section defines what value the subject needs to be compared to.
Note from our previous knowledge about values being equal(`==`) or identical(`===`), the `case` value is checked with loose comparison (`==`).
So a value does not need to be identical, only equal. This means that for the switch, the string `'1'` is considered equal to the integer `1`.

```php
echo 'You still need to pay';
```

Then we define the code that needs to be executed if the value is equal to the subject.

```php
break;
```

The `break` statement indicates that we're finished with the `switch`. A little further down we'll set up an example without `break` to see what that would look like.

```php
default:
    echo 'Oops! Seems like we\'ve lost your order';
```

The `default` case is entered when no other values are found to match the subject. Comparable to `else` in the `if` statement.

### Fall-through case

Like mentioned before, a `break` statement is needed in each `case` section if we only want to execute 1 piece of code. Let's modify that same `switch` from before but only using `break` in some cases.

```php
<?php
$state = 'pending_payment';
switch ($state) {
    case 'pending_payment':
        echo 'You still need to pay';
        break;
    case 'processing':
    case 'pending_shipment':
    case 'shipped':
        echo 'Your order is on its way!';
        break;
    default:
        echo 'Oops! Seems like we\'ve lost your order';
}
```

Here we repeat multiple `case` statements without any code. This can be useful if we want multiple values to do the same code.
So in this example, when `$state` is `'processing'`, `'pending_shipment'` or `'shipped'` it will all show the same message, namely `'Your order is on its way!'`.

We can also add additional logic without a `break`. Let's modify our example again.

```php
<?php
$state = 'pending_payment';
switch ($state) {
    case 'pending_payment':
        echo 'You still need to pay';
        break;
    case 'processing':
    case 'pending_shipment':
        echo 'Your order is on its way!';
    case 'shipped':
        echo 'It may have arrived already. Check your mail!';
        break;
    default:
        echo 'Oops! Seems like we\'ve lost your order';
}
```

In this instance, we dropped the `break`. Now for `'processing'` and `'pending_shipment'` it will say `'Your order is on its way! It may have arrived already. Check your mail!'`.
But for `shipped` it will only say `'It may have arrived already. Check your mail!'`.

The `switch` statement is by itself is already a fairly rare find in most codebases. Fall-through cases are even more uncommon.
Often there are simply more expressive ways to get the same result.

## Loops

There are several ways to loop but in essence they all are some variation of "run this piece of code until some condition is met".
Looping can also be referred to as iterating. Where each loop is an iteration.

### for

For loops are the most basic. In reality there will only be very specific cases where you will need this type of loop but since it's the most basic form of looping,
and in other programming languages often the only type of "for"-loop we will cover this one first.

Let's modify our `index.php` file with the following content:

```php
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
  echo $i;
}
```

Refreshing our page will show the result of the loop. Let's dissect the `for` loop further.

```php
for
```

Same as with the if statement, this starts off our for loop.

```php
$i = 0;
```

This part defines the start of the loop. In this case we create a variable `$i` and assign the value `0`.

```php
$i < 10;
```

Then comes the loop condition. This essentially means "loop while `$i` is smaller than 10". The for loop will continue looping until this part evaluates to `false`.

```php
$i++
```

And finally we have the step. The step part will run after each loop. In this case `$i++` is short for `$i += 1`, which in turn is short for `$i = $i + 1`.
While technically speaking `$i++` and `$i = $i + 1` are not the same, for our purpose here it is. If you want to see the differences try running the following code:

```php
<?php
$a = 0;
echo $a = $a + 1;

$b = 0;
echo $b++;

$c = 0;
echo ++$c;
```

As you can see, PHP first evaluates `$a = $a + 1`, which is equal to `1` and then passes that result to `echo`.
While with `$b++` it first passes the current value of `$b` to `echo`, and then increments the value.
The same can be done for decrementing using `-` instead of `+`.

So going back to the result of our loop, if we start with `$i = 0`, and loop while `$i < 10`, and after each loop `$i` is incremented with 1, and each iteration we print the value of `$i`, we get the result `0123456789`.

<Exercise title="Try getting the loop to print the numbers in reverse, starting at 9 and ending in 0 by modifying the start, loop condition and step portions.">
  <pre>
    <code className="language-php">
      &#60;?php
      for ($i = 9; $i >= 0; $i--) {`{
    echo $i;
}`}
    </code>
  </pre>
</Exercise>

### foreach

Next let's look at a `foreach` loop. In contrast to the regular `for` loop, this is the most popular loop in PHP applications.
This type of loop iterates over each element in an array (or anything that implements the `\Traversable` interface, but this is still way out of scope for now).

Let's modify our code again.

```php
<?php
$array = [1, 2, 3];
foreach ($array as $element) {
    echo $element;
}
```

Let's look at this a little more in-dept.

```php
$array = [1, 2, 3];
```

This simply creates a variable that holds an array of values `1, 2, 3`. You've already seen the `array` type in the previous chapter so you can see it in action here.

```php
foreach
```

Just as with the other control structures, we start our foreach loop.

```php
$array
```

This is the array we want to loop over.

```php
as $element
```

`$element` is a new variable that will be used temporarily to hold the value of the current iteration.

Looking at our result again, if we have an array that holds the values `1, 2, 3` and we loop over each value and echo it, we get `123`.

### while

While loops will continue looping until a condition is true. They can be used in identical fashion to our first loop type, `for` but are generally more flexible.
Like our first loop, it's less common to see while...do and do...while loops out in the wild.

```php
<?php
$i = 10;
while ($i > 0) {
    echo $i;
    $i--;
}
```

Once again, let's dissect this loop.

```
$i = 10;
```

We create a variable with value `10`.

```
while
```

We start our while loop.

```
$i > 10
```

This is the condition part of the while loop. It means "continue looping as long as $i is bigger than 10".

```
echo $i;
$i--;
```

We print the value of `$i` to the screen, and decrement `$i` with 1. Just as with `$i++`, `$i--` is short for `$i -= 1` which is short for `$i = $i - 1`.

Executing our code, we see `10987654321`.

### do...while

The do...while loop is exactly the same as the while loop with only 1 exception. The condition is evaluated at the end of each loop instead of at the beginning.
This means that even if we start with a condition that is not true, the loop will always be executed at least once.

Let's try doing exactly that.

```php
<?php
$i = 0;
do {
    echo 'I am still executed!';
} while ($i > 0);
```

Let's do a quick dissection of the do...while loop.

```php
do
```

We start our loop

```php
echo 'I am still executed!';
```

Echo some text to the page.

```php
while ($i > 0);
```

We check our condition to see if we need to repeat the loop.

Refreshing our page, we can see that it still printed something on the page.

### What loop do I use?

To decide which loop to use, you can ask yourself the following 4 questions in this order:
* Do I need to access each value in an array? => `foreach`
* Do I need a known amount of iterations? => `for`
* Do I need to loop while a condition is true? => `while`
* Do I need to loop while a condition is true, and it needs to be looped at least once? => `do...while`

## Other control structures

For the time being we're going to end here with control structures. PHP offers more control structures which we will discover throughout the course.
If you want to get a head-start, you can read more about other control structures in <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php">the PHP manual</Link>.

## Exercising

Practice makes perfect. We've now covered a big part of the basic PHP building blocks, it's important to get comfortable before we continue to the next chapter.
Here are some little challenges to exercise your knowledge so far. It is recommended to try a few before continuing to the next chapter.
