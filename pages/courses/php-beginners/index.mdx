# Learn PHP

Welcome to our PHP course. This course is meant for complete beginners to PHP.
You will start from scratch, incrementally building up until you feel comfortable starting your own projects and accomplishing your goals.

After this course you will have a basic understanding of:
* Creating a simple PHP website with a database,
* Using 3rd party libraries through Composer,
* Creating a REST API with PHP,

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have at least experimented with HTML and CSS as these are the core building blocks for any website.
If that was successful, you'll have no issues getting started with PHP. If you need a refresher,
there are many great resources available to get started with both.

We try to link to the official PHP manual as much as we can.
If you want to learn more about the subject, we highly recommend learning from a 1st party source.
The official PHP manual can be found <Link href="https://www.php.net/">here</Link>.

And that's it! Everything else will be covered in detail during this course.
Now let's get started with PHP!
