# 3. Autoloading

Automatically loading files is the first step in any application. In most applications this is handled by `composer`, a PHP package manager.
Comparable to `npm` or `yarn` in JavaScript. But since we're not allowed to use any 3rd party packages, we'll have to write our own autoloader.

Luckily PHP makes this really easy for us and provides some out-of-the box functions for us. We only need to make this once and then never touch it again.
This autoloader will replace the need to ever call `require` or `include` on a file again.
Since we will have quite a few files by the end of this journey, it will save us a lot of time and headaches.

## Professionals have standards

For autoloading, we're going to follow the PSR-4 recommendations. A bit of background since this won't be the only PSR recommendation we'll be following:

PSR stands for *"PHP Standards Recommendations"* and is an effort from the PHP community to standardize the way we do things.
You can find all the PSR documents on the <Link href="https://www.php-fig.org/">PHP-FIG</Link> website.

Looking at the list, we notice that there is a standard for autoloading, namely <Link href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</Link>. So we'll try to implement it closely.

To summarize and rephrase PSR-4 in less technical terms:
- Each class, interface, trait, enum or other structures need to be declared in its own file,
- The name of the file must match the classname,
- The namespace of each structure must match the directory structure on the filesystem,
- The namespace prefix must correspond with a base directory.

The table at the bottom of the page gives some good examples. For our use-case, our base directory is the `src` directory.
And as namespace prefix, we'll use `Api`.

So a concrete example for us would be:

The class: `Api\ExampleNamespace\MyClass` must be located in: `src/ExampleNamespace/MyClass.php`

## Implementating PSR-4

Let's start by creating a new file for this process named `autoload.php`. This `autoload.php` file and our `index.php` will be the only exceptions to the class/file conventions.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/autoload.php" code={`
class Psr4Autoloader
{
}
`} />

From the PSR-4 implementation, it sounds like we need to know 2 things. What is the base path, and what is our chosen namespace prefix.
So let's gather those during the `__construct` method and store those things in some fields.

Additionally, let's make a public method that can be used to start the autoloader called `register`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/autoload.php" code={`
class Psr4Autoloader
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $namespacePrefix,
        private readonly string $baseDirectory,
    ) {
    }

    public function register(): void
    {
    }
}
`} />

Previously we mentioned that PHP had some functions that could help us out here.
Let's look at <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php">`spl_autoload_register`</Link>.

As we can read in the documentation, it registers a function (the `$callback`) as an autoloader to try to load the file if a class can't be found.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/autoload.php" code={`
class Psr4Autoloader
{
    //..

    public function register(): void
    {
        spl_autoload_register(function (string $className) {
            $realClass = str_replace($this->namespacePrefix, $this->baseDirectory, $className);
            $file = str_replace('\\\\', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $realClass) . '.php';

            require $file;
        });
    }
}
`} />

To recap, we call the `spl_autoload_register` function with a function that takes a `$className`, like `\Api\CoolNamespace\MyClass`.
And turns it into a filename, replacing the namespace prefix with our base director, so it becomes `$baseDirectory/CoolNamespace/MyClass.php`.
Namespaces always use backslashes `\`, and some file systems can't handle those,
so we replace all backslashes with a special constant, `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`, to let PHP decide what slashes to use depending on the operating system.

Finally, below the class we need to create an instance of this class and call the `register` function.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/autoload.php" code={`
(new Psr4Autoloader('Api', __DIR__))->register();
`} />

We pass in our chosen namespace prefix, `Api`, and our base directory. For the base directory we use another special PHP constant named `__DIR__`.
It simply prints the current script directory. And as it happens, our `autoload.php` file is in our base directory `src`. So this is an exact match.

It's okay if this part isn't entirely clear. Like we already stated before, autoloading is not something that you usually do yourself.
It uses some rather less-common functions, like `spl_autoload_register`. Luckily we only need to do this once and we're finished.

## Using our autoloader

The last thing that's left to do is to include the autoloader in our application.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'autoload.php';
`} />

Voila, we've implemented PSR-4 to take care of loading all of our future classes.
Next up is looking at how we're going to structure our code, and getting started on our database connection.
