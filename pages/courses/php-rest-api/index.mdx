# REST API From Scratch

In this course we will go on a journey through building your own REST API that can be interacted with using JavaScript or external parties.

In this course we will cover the following topics:
* HTTP requests and responses
* RESTful API design
* PHP application architecture
* Interacting with relational databases
* Building your own starter boilerplate REST framework to develop your API on

We do want to mention that building a REST API from scratch is rarely done.
Nowadays 3rd party packages and frameworks make it much easier and safer.
Our personal recommendation for anything API related would be to use <Link href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</Link>,
which is built on the widely popular <Link href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</Link> framework.
**Let it be clear** that the purpose of this course is purely educational to gain a deeper understanding
of what goes into making an API from scratch when 3rd party packages are not involved.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have at least a decent understanding of PHP and its syntax.
You should be able to read and write PHP quite comfortably as we will not be explaining PHP itself, but rather how it is used in an API context.
If you need a refresher on PHP, or have never used it before, you can use our "PHP For Beginners" to get up to speed.

Optionally, we will be working with Docker to host our local development server.
You are free to use your own LAMP stack, the minimal tested versions for this course are **PHP >=8.1** (with the pdo and pdo_mysql extensions), and **MySQL >=8.0**.

* <Link href="https://github.com/jannes-io/php-course-docker">Download our basic LAMP stack</Link>

We're also going to need a HTTP client that makes it easier to test and debug our application. We'll be using Postman for that.
We recommend using the desktop version.

You should also check out our course philosophy page.
It will explain how we're different from other courses and formal education as well as give you some insight in how to interpret our courses.

Introductions out of the way, let's get right into it!
