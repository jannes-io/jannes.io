## The HTTP Protocol

Understanding the HTTP protocol is essential in web development, particularly in building APIs.
In this section, we will explore HTTP requests and responses from the perspective of an API.

A request is a standardized piece of information that an API receives. It can be a request for data or an action to be performed.
Conversely, a response is the API's answer to the request.

HTTP requests contain specific components, including the URL of the requested resource,
a method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT), headers that provide additional information about the request,
and an optional body that contains data.

On the other hand, HTTP responses are formulated by the server and include a status code (e.g., OK, Not Found, Internal Server Error),
headers that provide additional information about the response,
and an optional body that contains requested data, the result of an action, or an error message.

## Modeling HTTP in PHP

Before we can make any controllers that handle the HTTP protocol, we need to model the protocol in our code.
There is a standard for request and response modeling in PSR, namely PSR-7. PSR-7 is a little bit too extensive for what we need here so we're going to
skip on this standard for now and create a simplified version ourselves.
We'll be making a couple of classes in `Framework` to translate HTTP gibberish into understandable bits of data that can be passed around efficiently.

### Request

As we discussed before, the request contains the following 4 components:
- Method
- URL
- Headers
- Body

In our case, for our API, we're going to take some shortcuts and only model what we need for now, which is the method, a path (a subsection of the URL), and the body.

Starting with the method, the HTTP method can only be 1 of a handful of <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">different options</Link>.
In our API, we will only be accepting 4 different methods for now. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. These methods roughly translate to:

- GET: Client wants to retrieve an entity,
- POST: Client wants to create an entity or send data for processing,
- PUT: Client wants to update an existing entity,
- DELETE: Client wants to delete an entity,

So the best way to model this in code, would be to use an `Enum`, which we'll call `RequestMethod`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/RequestMethod.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Model;

enum RequestMethod: string
{
    case Get = 'GET';
    case Post = 'POST';
    case Put = 'PUT';
    case Delete = 'DELETE';
    case Options = 'OPTIONS';
}
`} />

The other components of our request will be simple `string` types. So let's make our `Request` class.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Request.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Model;

class Request
{
    public function __construct(
        string $method,
        string $path,
        string $body,
    ) {
    }
}
`} />

For our `$method`, let's transform it to our `RequestMethod` enum using the static `::from` function that is available on all Enums,
and create a `private` field for it. The other fields can be stored directly as `private` fields.
Also, if you remember from the HTTP protocol, the `body` of a request is optional. So we'll default this value to a blank string.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Request.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Model;

class Request
{
    private RequestMethod $method;

    public function __construct(
        string $method,
        private string $path,
        private string $body = '',
    ) {
        $this->method = RequestMethod::from($method);
    }
}
`} />

Now let's also add some `getters` to retrieve the values.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Request.php" code={`
class Request
{
    // ...

    public function getMethod(): RequestMethod
    {
        return $this->method;
    }

    public function getPath(): string
    {
        return $this->path;
    }

    public function getBody(): string
    {
        return $this->body;
    }
}
`} />

To complete our `Request` object, we're going to add a static function that'll allow us to easily create the request.
Since PHP stores request info in a multitude of different <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">superglobals</Link>
and files, we'll use this function to combine everything in one place.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Request.php" code={`
class Request
{
    // ...

    public static function createFromGlobals(): self
    {
        return new self(
            $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'],
            $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],
            file_get_contents('php://input') ?: ''
        );
    }
}
`} />

The `$_SERVER` superglobal can provide us with the method, through `['REQUEST_METHOD]`, the path is also found in `$_SERVER`, under `['REQUEST_URI']`.
And finally, the body of a request is stored in a special temporary file at the location of `php://input`. So we grab that and default to an empty string
if no body is supplied by the request.

Let's test this out in our `index.php`:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request;

$request = Request::createFromGlobals();
var_dump($request);
`} />

Now send a `GET` request to `localhost/hello-from-request` using Postman, and you should see a result similar to this:
<Snippet language="txt" code={`
object(Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request)#3 (4) {
  ["method":"Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request":private] => enum(Api\\Framework\\Model\\RequestMethod::Get)
  ["path":"Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request":private] => string(19) "/hello-from-request"
  ["body":"Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request":private] => string(0) ""
}
`} />

Looking at this, we now know a request was made to `/hello-from-request`, with the method `GET`, and an empty body.
How we are going to handle this request will be for the next chapter, for now we're not yet done with the HTTP protocol, we still need to formulate a response.

### Response

Similarly to the `Request` object, we're also going to be making a `Response` object. If we look back at the HTTP protocol, a response consists of the following components:

- Status code
- Headers
- Content

In this case, we will need all 3 to formulate a proper response.

Let's start with the status codes.
It's detrimental that the correct status code is provided to the client. Especially if we're talking about a REST API.

Before we can start modeling these we're going to take a closer look at a couple of the status codes. We don't need to model
every single status code, only the ones that are going to be relevant to us.

Status codes are grouped per hundred:
- 100-199: informational codes that aren't relevant to us at all, so we're going to skip these,
- 200-299: success codes. We'll be using a couple of these, mainly 200, 201 and 204.
- *200* - Ok: Everything went as expected and there might be data in the response body for the client to process,
- *201* - Created: A new resource was created,
- *204* - No Content: The request was accepted, and processing was successful, but the server has nothing to send back.
- 300-399: redirection codes. Same as the 1xx codes, we'll be skipping these.
- 400-499: client error codes. These will be relevant, we'll be using 400, 401, 403 and 404.
- *400* - Bad Request: The client sent a malformed or invalid request that cannot be processed,
- *401* - Unauthorized: The client is not logged in and the resource is protected,
- *403* - Forbidden: The client is logged in, but does not have access to the resource,
- *404* - Not Found: The requested resource can not by found by the server.
- 500-599: server error codes. Here we'll only use 500.
- *500* - Internal Server Error: Something went wrong on the server's side.

For a good resource containing the full list of response status codes and their meaning, head over to the <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">MDN HTTP status</Link> reference.

These look fairly similar to the request methods in terms of modeling them in PHP. So for the HTTP status code, we'll also use an `Enum`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/HttpStatusCode.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Model;

enum HttpStatusCode: int
{
    // 2xx
    case Ok = 200;
    case Created = 201;
    case NoContent = 204;

    // 4xx
    case BadRequest = 400;
    case Unauthorized = 401;
    case Forbidden = 403;
    case NotFound = 404;

    // 5xx
    case InternalServerError = 500;
}
`} />

For readability, we've separated them by hundreds. If we need to add any in the future, it'll be easy to find where to insert them.

Looking at the other fields of the response, we've got headers and the body. Headers are always in the form of a `key => value` format, so we can store those
in an `array`. And the content field is identical to the request body, we can just store that in a `string`.

That gives us the following `Response` class:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Response.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Model;

class Response
{
    public function __construct(
        private string $content,
        private HttpStatusCode $statusCode,
        private array $headers = [],
    ) {
    }
}
`} />

Let's also add some `getters` to retrieve the values again.
<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Response.php" code={`
class Response
{
    // ...

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->content;
    }

    public function getStatusCode(): HttpStatusCode
    {
        return $this->statusCode;
    }

    public function getHeaders(): array
    {
        return $this->headers;
    }
}
`} />

To test our response, we need to call the correct PHP functions. Let's create a `Response` object in our `index.php`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Framework\\Model\\HttpStatusCode;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Response;

$response = new Response(
    'Hello from my PHP response object',
    HttpStatusCode::Ok
);
`} />

To actually send this response to the client, we need 3 php functions.
- <PHPNet fn="http_response_code" />: to set the status code
- <PHPNet fn="header" />: to set a singular header, formatted as "$key: $value",
- <PHPNet fn="echo" />: to send content

So let's call these functions with the data from our response:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Framework\\Model\\HttpStatusCode;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Response;

$response = new Response(
    'Hello from my PHP response object',
    HttpStatusCode::Ok
);

http_response_code($response->getStatusCode()->value);
foreach ($response->getHeaders() as $key => $value) {
    header("$key: $value");
}
echo $response->getContent();
`} />

It's important to always `echo` the content as last operation. It's not possible for PHP to send headers after anything is sent using `echo` or other functions
that output data. For example, the following snippet of code will result in a warning regarding headers being sent after any output has been sent:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
// ...

$response = new Response(
    'Hello from my PHP response object',
    HttpStatusCode::Ok,
    ['Content-Type' => 'application/json']
);

echo $response->getContent();
http_response_code($response->getStatusCode()->value);
foreach ($response->getHeaders() as $key => $value) {
    header("$key: $value");
}
`} />

Reverting back to our working `index.php`, if we now perform a request using Postman, you should simply see the following output:

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
Hello from my PHP response object
`} />

And in Postman you should also be able to see "Status: 200 OK".

To finish off this chapter, let's abstract away the sending of the response and delegate that functionality
to the `Response` object itself.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Model/Response.php" code={`
class Response
{
    // ...

    public function send(): never
    {
        http_response_code($this->getStatusCode()->value);
        foreach ($this->getHeaders() as $key => $value) {
            header("$key: $value");
        }
        echo $this->getContent();
        exit(0);
    }
}
`} />

We've added an extra <PHPNet fn="exit" /> at the end, and set the return type of the function to `never`.
This will ensure that sending the response is the last thing our program will ever do to prevent
the previously mentioned issues with sending content and headers in mixed orders.

Now we can use this function in `index.php`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
// ...

$response = new Response(
    'Hello from my PHP response object',
    HttpStatusCode::Ok,
    ['Content-Type' => 'application/json']
);
$response->send();
`} />

Try modifying `$response` with some different values and different status codes to familiarize yourself
with what it looks like in Postman before heading over to the next chapter.
