# 4. PDO Database Connection

Naturally, we're going to want to store and retrieve data from a database. MySQL is one of the most common
database engines around and even more so for the PHP language.

## Creating a Database

Our Docker setup already contains a MySQL server and a handy tool called PHPMyAdmin that allows us to browse
and modify databases from within our browser. This tool is exposed on port `8080`. If you are not using
our Docker preset. You'll probably have a MySQL client already, you can perfectly use that as well.

So open up a browser of your choosing, and navigate to `localhost:8080`. You should be presented by
a log in screen. The default username is `root`, and for testing purposes, the password is also `root`.
Obviously when you want to build a production PHP application, you'll have to configure your own password.
If you're planning to use our Docker LAMP stack for production,
you can change the root password in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Once logged in, press the "New" button on the top left.

Fill in the name of the database, in our case we'll be using `my_api`, pick `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` from the dropdown menu and press "create".
Nowadays, unicode is the most common database format for new databases. It essentially sets the character set of your database.
We'll not go into any more information about the charset since it's not very common to use others.
Just know that on MySQL 8+, `utf8mb4` and specifically the `unicode_ci` set is the most universal,
and you should pick that one unless you know what you're doing.

## Defining the Domain

As seen in the <Link href="/courses/php-rest-api/01-what-is-rest">first chapter</Link> of this course, our domain is a Blog. Our main entities will be:
- Post: a blog article with a title, some content and an author,
- Author: the poster of the post,
- User: linked to the author, will be used for checking security.

Creating and updating the MySQL schema automatically based on PHP code is the job of an
<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</Link> (Object Relational Mapper) or
<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer">DBAL</Link> (Database Abstraction Layer) like
<Link href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</Link> or <Link href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent">Eloquent</Link>.
Since these are fairly complex topics in and of themselves, we will not be making any automatic PHP object to MySQL schema mapping.
However, we will take some inspiration from these packages for parts of our API as they are battle hardened and easy to understand.

## MySQL Schema

Let's go ahead and prepare some tables in PHPMyAdmin. First we'll create our `user` table.

The user object will be used to log in and authenticate someone or something. The user table will have the following columns:
- id
- username
- password
- email
- roles

On our hypothetical blog, regular users are not allowed to post, but `authors` are. Granted they give a bit more information about themselves:
- id
- first_name
- last_name
- user

Finally, the `posts` themselves, consisting of the fields:
- id
- title
- content
- author

Since it's easier to share the schema using SQL code, you can execute SQL code when going to the "SQL" tab after selecting your database on the left.

<img src="/img/php-rest-api/04-execute-sql.png" />

Copy/paste the code below in the big textarea and press the "Go" button.

<Snippet language="sql" code={`
CREATE TABLE \`users\` (
    \`id\` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    \`username\` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    \`password\` VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    \`email\` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    \`roles\` TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (\`id\`),
    UNIQUE \`unique_username\` (\`username\`),
    UNIQUE \`unique_email\` (\`email\`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE \`authors\` (
    \`id\` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    \`first_name\` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    \`last_name\` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    \`user\` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (\`id\`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE \`authors\` ADD CONSTRAINT \`authors_user_fk\` FOREIGN KEY (user) REFERENCES \`users\`(\`id\`);

CREATE TABLE \`posts\` (
    \`id\` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    \`title\` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    \`content\` TEXT NOT NULL,
    \`author\` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (\`id\`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;
ALTER TABLE \`posts\` ADD CONSTRAINT \`posts_author_fk\` FOREIGN KEY (author) REFERENCES \`authors\`(\`id\`);
`} />

If all went well, you should now have 3 tables, `authors`, `posts` and `users`. Since MySQL isn't the topic of this course
we won't be diving any deeper into this schema. From now on, we will only be using PHPMyAdmin to check or create test data, all other interactions
will be done using PHP.

## PHP Entities

We already hinted at the term "Entity" in the previous section. An entity is an object that contains some data.
Like the user entity, contains all the columns of the user table.

Since this will be the first time writing classes in this project. We'll also briefly discuss the directory structure we'll be using.
Inside of `src` we'll have 2 directories.
- Framework: Anything generic that has nothing to do with the business logic of your application will go in here.
- Domain: Business logic and <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering)">domain</Link> logic goes here.
This will contain all the entities, repositories, controllers, services,... that have to do with the domain.

If we look at our entities so far, we have 1 that would fall under `Framework`, and 2 that would be specific to the blogging `Domain`.
Since `users` will be used for authenticating and security, we'll be placing that one in the `Framework` folder. This is a generic entity that you'll need
in almost every API. Security is a complex topic with many different implementations. For our use-case, we'll be going with a simple OAuth2 server implementation.
For now, you don't need to worry about any of that. As long as it makes some sense that `users` are generic to most APIs, while `authors` and `posts` are
very clearly specific to the blogging domain.

So let's create some directories and files:
<Snippet language="text" code={`
src/
  Domain/
    Entity/
      Author.php
      Post.php
  Framework/
    Entity/
      User.php
  autoload.php
  index.php
`} />

As you can see, directories are always `PascalCase` and singular. This is just a code style standard. You can find these "rules" in
<Link href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/">PSR-12</Link>. There are external tools that allow you to automatically format
your code according to these rules, however, since we're limited to no 3rd party plugins or tools, we'll have to manage our own code.
All code provided in this course will follow PSR-12. If you use PHPStorm, you're in luck,
<Link href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-code-style.html#configure-code-style-schemes">PHPStorm has PSR-12</Link> built-in.

For our entities, we're going to mirror our database 1:1, where each field in the database has a corresponding public field in the entity.

Starting with `authors`:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Entity/Author.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Domain\\Entity;

class Author
{
    public int $id;
    public string $firstName;
    public string $lastName;
    public int $user;
}
`} />

Next up, `posts`:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Entity/Post.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Domain\\Entity;

class Post
{
    public int $id;
    public string $title;
    public string $content;
    public int $author;
}
`} />

And finally, `users`:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Entity/Post.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Entity;

class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $username;
    public string $password;
    public string $email;
    public array $roles;
}
`} />

As discussed in the previous chapter with autoloading, our namespace has to match our directory structure and start with `Api`.
So the namespace `Api\Framework\Entity` matches the directory `src/Framework/Entity`. And the classname must match the file name.
This makes the full file name: `src/Framework/Entity/User.php`. And the full classname is `Api\Framework\Entity\User`.

## Connecting to the Database using PHP

We will need some place to store our connection information for our database. Ideally, in a real world API,
these would be stored in the environment variables of the server. Or `.env` files. But to keep things simple,
we'll be using a simple PHP file containing constants.

So go ahead and create a PHP file called `config.php` in the root directory with 3 constants.
The DSN of our database (formatted connection string of our MySQL host and the database name we just created), and the username and password of our user.
We will also give our constants a prefix, so they're separated from any PHP constants that already exist and easily identifiable.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/config.php" code={`
<?php

const API_CONFIG_DB_DSN = 'mysql:host=mysql;dbname=my_api';
const API_CONFIG_DB_USER = 'root';
const API_CONFIG_DB_PASSWORD = 'root';
`} />

We will need to load this config file manually, since it's not a class. So let's go ahead and `require` it in our `index.php`.
This will be the final file we `require` ourselves. Everything else will be taken care of by our autoloader.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

`} />

We now have everything required to start interacting with our database. In the next chapter, we'll put everything we've made
so far to the test and actually fetch and store some data from/to our database.
