# 2. Calling PHP From Postman

Viewing the results of our PHP script can be done in multiple ways.
So far you've probably only used your browser or JavaScript to interact with websites written in PHP.
That's about to change. Postman is specialised in showing the results of HTTP requests in a more easily digestible way for what we'll be using it for.
First let's briefly touch on running our PHP web server, although you should already be familiar with this.

## HTTP Server

Since we'll be starting from scratch, we've got some setup to do before we can get into actually building an API.
First, let's familiar ourselves with our environment. In the first chapter, you should've installed Docker Desktop
and grabbed our basic LAMP template. If you have chosen to go with your own LAMP stack, you can skip ahead to the next section.
Below you can find the links to both Docker Desktop and our LAMP template again.

* <Link href="https://github.com/jannes-io/php-course-docker">Download our basic LAMP stack</Link>

If you need help installing the HTTP server you can find the instructions in <Link href="/courses/php-beginners/01-what-is-php">this chapter</Link> of our "PHP For Beginners" course.

In your project root directory (the folder that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file), start the docker stack from a terminal:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you run into any Docker related issues, mainly name conflicts because of prior courses followed. You can always safely delete containers from Docker Desktop.
This does not delete any files, it simply cleans up the Docker images and releases the images, containers, volumes,... .

In the future, you can also use Docker Desktop to launch your project instead of using the command line.

We'll be writing all of our code in the `src` directory. You should find an empty `index.php` file already prepared.
Let's move over to Postman to confirm that our server is running.

## Postman

To confirm our server is running, let's modify our `index.php` script to output something, so we're not staring at a blank screen.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
echo 'Hello from REST API';
`} />

Now, open Postman and press the '+' button to create a new request.

In the request bar, fill in the URL of our webserver that's running PHP. (`http://localhost`).

And press "Send". Now we should see the text "`Hello from REST API`" on our screen.

<img src="/img/php-rest-api/02-postman-hello.png" />

Eureka! Our server is up and running, so we can move on to writing some actual PHP.
