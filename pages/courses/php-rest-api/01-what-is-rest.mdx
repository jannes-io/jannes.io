# 1. What is a REST API?

To understand what we're about to build, a bit of theory is mandatory
We'll keep it brief and promise to dive into some actual code on the next chapter but this background information is **crucial** to our success.
If you're already familiar with the terms REST and API, and know the HTTP standards, feel free to skip this chapter.

REST and APIs are both topics that are very extensively documented. Our goal here is to look at them from a practical standpoint.
If anything was left out, this was most likely intentional to stay on-track and not turn this course into a 500 chapter behemoth.
We encourage you to look up the terms REST and API if you want to really take a deep-dive into the theory and history of
web architecture.

## What is an API?

An Application Programming Interface, or API in short, can be thought of as the outwards facing interface that can be used by one or more other systems.
If you've written any PHP classes so far, you've actually already written APIs. For example, the public methods on a class can be considered that class' API.
Now when we talk about REST APIs, we're just taking it one step further.

With the uprising of "dynamic" web applications, the need for backend APIs have risen immensely. Early websites typically had everything more embedded.
Data was sent to the server in a web form, the server did some magic with it and computed some response HTML, and the browser rendered that HTML.
Today, this is very different. And REST APIs have become something every web developer needs to be intimately comfortable with.

In our practical use-case, our API will be used as a layer between our database,
and a front-end client such as web applications (plain JavaScript, React, Vue, ...), mobile apps, desktop apps, other servers,... .

## What is REST?

REST stands for "**Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer", in layman's terms, the transfer of state between applications using a generic format.
State is simply the term used for data. An application's state is everything that can be retrieved and represented by the application.
For example a row in a database, a file in storage, data from other APIs,... .

Using REST forces an API to follow certain rules and conventions.
This way it is easy for other applications to interact with your API, since the format and standards are already defined.

HTTP REST APIs uses the HTTP format to communicate. We won't go into these standards for now as we'll cover them *extensively* during the implementation in PHP.

## Tie the knot

So with that understanding, we will be building an API that uses the REST principals to communicate data.
Which in turn uses the HTTP standards to communicate data.
Our goal will be to make a re-usable API that can easily be extended, independent of the domain.
Some typical examples of a domain would be a blog, a book store, a todo list,... .
For our API, we'll pretend it is going to be used as the backend for a Blog. This is purely fictional,
and the goal of this course is not to make a blogging API. Our goal is to make a generic REST API server that can be used for any domain.

Let's get our hands dirty with some code now.
