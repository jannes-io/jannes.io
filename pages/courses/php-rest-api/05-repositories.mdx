## Repositories

All of our interactions with the database will follow the Repository Pattern. In short, a repository
will encapsulate all logic to access the database and form the plumbing between our business logic and the database.

Each entity will have its own repository, but all these repositories will share some common functionality.
So let's start by creating an abstract repository. Since this is some generic class that isn't related to our
blog domain, we place it in the `Framework` folder, and we'll even give it its own subdirectory, `Repository`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Repository;

use PDO;

abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    protected PDO $db;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->db = new PDO(API_CONFIG_DB_DSN, API_CONFIG_DB_USER, API_CONFIG_DB_PASSWORD);
    }
}
`} />

As you can see, in the constructor of our repository we initialize a `PDO` instance, and set it to a protected variable named `$db`.
Because it's protected, all of our child repositories will be able to access the database directly in case they need to perform any complex queries.

Additionally, we're going to create 2 more protected variables. `$table` and `$entity`. These will allow child repositories to configure
which entity they belong to, and where to find that entity in the database.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
<?php
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    protected PDO $db;
    protected string $table;
    protected string $entity;

    // ...
}
`} />

Next up, we'll create some generic functions to retrieve records from our database. All these functions should start with "find".
And when creating our own custom queries in the entity's repositories, it's good to follow this convention. This can help when using
a smart code editor. Simply by typing `$repository->find` you'll instantly see all the different functions that are available for retrieving data.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
<?php
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function find(int $id): ?object
    {
    }

    public function findAll(): array
    {
    }

    public function findBy(array $criteria): array
    {
    }
}
`} />

- `find`: This function attempts to retrieve 1 item from the database by id. If found, it returns an instance of the entity. If not, it returns null.
- `findAll`: Speaks for itself, results all items from the database and returns them as an array of entity instances.
- `findBy`: Given some criteria, like `['email' => 'user@example.com']`, will fetch all items matching the criteria (`WHERE email = user@example.com`)
and return them as an array of entity instances.

## Testing Abstract Repository

Since this will the first time retrieving data from the database, let's start with a very bare-bones implementation of `find` and
dump the result of the query. This will make it easier to debug and test as we go.
It's worth noting that usually testing isn't done by refreshing a browser or sending postman requests.
Testing pieces of code is an intricate subject that is not covered by this course. Additionally,
debugging is usually done using an actual debugger such as XDebug. Since not everyone has this set up, we'll limit ourselves
to testing using <PHPNet fn="var_dump" />, <PHPNet fn="echo" />, <PHPNet fn="die" />,...

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
<?php
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function find(int $id): ?object
    {
        $statement = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM {$this->table} WHERE id = :id");
        $statement->execute(['id' => $id]);

        $result = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        var_dump($result);die;
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

First, we prepare a simple select statement. You may have heard that using PHP strings in queries is bad practice,
or will cause "SQL injections". That's misinformation to a certain extent. If you, the programmer, control the string that's going
into your query, it's totally safe. It's only dangerous if this string comes from user input and is not sanitized properly.

Anyway, next up we execute the statement using the `id` parameter.
And finally, we <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetch"> fetch the record in `PDO::FETC_ASSOC` mode</Link>.
The `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` mode returns the record as an associative `array` (`[key => value]`).

Now let's implement one of our entity repositories so we can test our code. Let's start with the user repository.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/UserRepository.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Repository;

use Api\\Framework\\Entity\\User;

class UserRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    protected string $table = 'users';
    protected string $entity = User::class;
}
`} />

By now you should know the drill, `user` stuffs is in the `Framework` folder, because it's generic to the entire API,
since it's a repository, it goes in the `Repository` folder. And the filename must match the classname so `UserRepository.php`.
If you have an intelligent editor, it can automatically generate the namespaces based on context. If not, it must match the
filepath, starting with `Api`, so it becomes `namespace Api\Framework\Repository;`.

We extend our repository from the previously created `AbstractRepository`, and set the protected `$table` and `$entity` fields.

Finally, we can construct our `UserRepository` in `index.php`, and try to retrieve an item.


<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Framework\\Repository\\UserRepository;

$userRepository = new UserRepository();
$user = $userRepository->find(1);
var_dump($user);

`} />

If everything went correctly, you should see `bool(false)` when sending a request to `http://localhost` in Postman. Since we haven't
inserted any users yet, this result makes sense. Let's open up PHPMyAdmin, and insert a test user. Using a browser, navigate to
`http://localhost:8080`. On the left, select our database `my_api`, select the `users` table. Then, on the top navigation, click on "Insert".
Leave the `id` blank, since it's auto-generated. Fill in a username, for example `tester`. Leave `password` blank, we'll cover
passwords later in this course. Set a test email, `tester@example.org` and leave `roles` blank as well.
Finally, press "Go" and the record will be inserted.

Now when we send another request using Postman, we should see some data show up.

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
array(5) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["username"]=>
  string(6) "tester"
  ["password"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["email"]=>
  string(18) "tester@example.org"
  ["roles"]=>
  string(0) ""
}
`} />

Excellent. Our connection with the database is working correctly, and we can continue implementing our `find` method.

## Deserialization

Our `find` method is almost completed. There's just 1 step that's missing. Turning the raw record into an instance of our class.
This process is called <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</Link>. Simply put,
serialization is the process of going from one representation of an object to another:

- Serialization: going from a format that is easy to work with in code to a format that is easy to store.
- Deserialization: going from a format that is easy to store to a format that is easy to work with in code.

PHP offers a couple of standard helpers, interfaces and functions to achieve this process.
For example, `json_encode` is an example of serialization (object/array -> json), while `json_decode` is an example of deserialization (json -> object/array).

In this case, we're going from an `array`, which is easy to store and retrieve from our database, to an instance of a class.
PHP offers a native way to do this conversion simply by doing `(array)$obj` or `(object)$array`.

Let's try it out by modifying our `find` function in `AbstractRepository`:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function find(int $id): ?object
    {
        $statement = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM {$this->table} WHERE id = :id");
        $statement->execute(['id' => $id]);

        $result = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        return (object)$result;
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

When sending another request to `localhost`, we see the following output:

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
object(stdClass)#6 (5) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["username"]=>
  string(6) "tester"
  ["password"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["email"]=>
  string(18) "tester@example.org"
  ["roles"]=>
  string(0) ""
}
`} />

Hmm. Not really what we are looking for. As you can see from the `var_dump`, our object is an instance of `stdClass`.
We don't want that, we want an instance of `User`. So we'll have to write our own deserialize function.

We'll make this function `protected. Since this will allow child repositories to overwrite it in case they need some special steps
depending on the entity they're deserializing to.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    protected function deserialize(array $data): object
    {
    }
}
`} />

We'll be going from an associative array (`[field => value]`) to an `object`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    protected function deserialize(array $data): object
    {
        $obj = new $this->entity();
        foreach ($data as $field => $value) {
            $obj->$field = $value;
        }
        return $obj;
    }
}
`} />

This function uses some of PHP's <PHPNet namespace="language" fn="namespaces.dynamic.php" label="dynamic language features" />
to turn our key/value array into an instance of the entity we want.
Dynamic language features is generally a last resort since it's very easy to introduce bugs this way.
However, the "correct" way would revolve around using <Link href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclass.php">Reflection</Link>.
Since Reflection can be given an entire course of its own, we're going to accept the trade-off here.
If you're comfortable with the Reflection API, feel free to rewrite this function.
Let's look at some of these dynamic language features using a simplified example:

First, the `::class` static property simply returns the fully qualified classname (namespace + class).
Remember how we used this in `UserRepository`'s `$entity` protected field?

<Snippet language="php" code={`
<?php
$userClass = User::class;
var_dump($userClass); // => string(25) "Api\\Framework\\Entity\\User"
`} />

Then, we used that string to instantiate a class.

<Snippet language="php" code={`
<?php
$userClass = User::class;
$user = new $userClass();
var_dump($user); // => object(Api\\Framework\\Entity\\User)#5
`} />

Finally, we use another dynamic language feature to set the correct field to its corresponding value.

<Snippet language="php" code={`
<?php
$userClass = User::class;
$userNameField = 'username';

$user = new $userClass();
$user->$userNameField = 'tester';

var_dump($user->username);
`} />

Alright, back to our repositories. The last thing to do for our `find` method is to use our new `deserialize` function.
Like we tested before, `$result` will be `false` if nothing is found, and will return an `array` if it does find an item.
We don't like using `false` as a value, `null` is much more correct in this context. Either we have an item, or we've got nothing.
This also allows us to use a shorter syntax for types (`?object` vs `object|false`). So we'll use a ternary,
if the result is an `array`, deserialize and return it, else, return `null`.

Our complete `find` function should now look like this:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function find(int $id): ?object
    {
        $statement = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM {$this->table} WHERE id = :id");
        $statement->execute(['id' => $id]);

        $result = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        return is_array($result)
            ? $this->deserialize($result)
            : null;
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Sending another request to `locahost` now throws an error. Damn.

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign string to property User::$roles of type array
`} />

Right, makes sense! Our database has `roles` as a string, while our user object expects an array.
This is exactly why we made the `deserialize` function `protected`. We can now override this function
in our `UserRepository` and turn this `string` into an `array`.

Now, the exact details of what these `$roles` will be explained later, when we get to security. For now it's
just important to know that we'll store the roles in the database as a comma(`,`)-separated list.

Let's modify our user repository to `explode` the roles field before passing it to the `deserialize` function.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/UserRepository.php" code={`
class UserRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    protected function deserialize(array $data): object
    {
        $roles = $data['roles'];
        $data['roles'] = empty($roles) ? [] : explode(',', $roles);
        return parent::deserialize($data);
    }
}
`} />

So, if `$roles` is empty, set `$data['roles']` to an empty `array`, else, use the `explode` function to split the roles on `','`.

Now when we send another request, we can see our `User` object with all fields filled in and matching the database!

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
object(Api\\Framework\\Entity\\User)#7 (5) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["username"]=>
  string(6) "tester"
  ["password"]=>
  string(0) ""
  ["email"]=>
  string(18) "tester@example.org"
  ["roles"]=>
  array(0) {
  }
}
`} />

Perfect! Before continuing with the other `find` methods. Let's implement all of our repositories and test them out.

`AuthorRepository`:
<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Repository/AuthorRepository.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Domain\\Repository;

use Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Author;
use Api\\Framework\\Repository\\AbstractRepository;

class AuthorRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    protected string $table = 'authors';
    protected string $entity = Author::class;
}
`} />

`PostRepository`:
<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Repository/PostRepository.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Domain\\Repository;

use Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Post;
use Api\\Framework\\Repository\\AbstractRepository;

class PostRepository extends AbstractRepository
{
    protected string $table = 'posts';
    protected string $entity = Post::class;
}
`} />

Remember, `author` and `post` belong to our domain, not the framework, so they go under `src/Domain/Repository`!

Also insert some values using PHPMyAdmin, exactly like we did for the `users` table. Remember our database schema from the previous chapter?
A post requires an author, and an author requires a user. That's why we started with users. So next up will be creating an author for our user.
Just using some test data:

- id: auto generated, so leave it blank,
- first_name: `tester`,
- last_name: `author`,
- user: `1` - this one is important as it needs to correlate to an id in the `users` table.

And finally, create a post for the author.

- id: auto generated,
- title: `my cool post`
- content: `this post is very very cool`
- author: `1` - again, this needs to correlate to an id, this time to an author in the `authors` table.

Let's modify our `index.php` to use our new repositories to retrieve the records we just inserted manually.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Framework\\Repository\\UserRepository;
use Api\\Domain\\Repository\\AuthorRepository;
use Api\\Domain\\Repository\\PostRepository;

$user = (new UserRepository())->find(1);
var_dump($user);

$author = (new AuthorRepository())->find(1);
var_dump($author);

$post = (new PostRepository())->find(1);
var_dump($post);
`} />

Sending a request to `localhost` using postman, we can see something strange happening to our `Author` object.

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
object(Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Author)#8 (4) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["firstName"]=>
  uninitialized(string)
  ["lastName"]=>
  uninitialized(string)
  ["user"]=>
  int(1)
  ["first_name"]=>
  string(6) "tester"
  ["last_name"]=>
  string(6) "author"
}
`} />

As mentioned before, those dynamic language features can easily introduce bugs, and here we've got one of those.
Pay special attention to the fields `firstName` and `lastName`. They're set to `uninitialized`. Meanwhile
we've got 2 fields that aren't supposed to exist on our class, `first_name` and `last_name`. This is because
our database uses `snake_case` as name convention, while our PHP classes uses `camelCase`.

Since this will be the case for all of our entities, we'll have to modify the `deserialize` function in `AbstractRepository`.
Let's analyze the source of this bug.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    protected function deserialize(array $data): object
    {
        $obj = new $this->entity();
        foreach ($data as $field => $value) { // $field is 'first_name'
            $obj->$field = $value; // $obj->first_name = $value <- this is not what we want
        }
        return $obj;
    }
}
`} />

We'll have to convert more between different case types in the future, so let's make a dedicated class for the purpose of changing casing.
This is something that can be used anywhere regardless of the domain, so we'll place it in `Framework`. The subdirectoy for these "helper" classes
will be `Service`. So we'll make a class `NameConverter` in `src/Framework/Service/NameConverter.php`. In this class, we'll convert
from `snake_case` to `camelCase` and vice versa.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Service/NameConverter.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Service;

class NameConverter
{
    public function convertSnakeCaseToCamelCase(string $snake): string
    {
    }

    public function convertCamelCaseToSnakeCase(string $camel): string
    {
    }
}
`} />

Let's start with snake to camel. Looking at the structure of `snake_case` and `camelCase`, we can see that
we'll have to uppercase the first characters of each word (<PHPNet fn="ucwords" />) except for the first one (<PHPNet fn="lcfirst" />).
And finally, get rid of the underscores (<PHPNet fn="str_replace" />).

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Service/NameConverter.php" code={`
class NameConverter
{
    public function convertSnakeCaseToCamelCase(string $snake): string
    {
        return lcfirst(str_replace('_', '', ucwords($snake, '_')));
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Next up, we've got `camelCase` to `snake_case`. This will be a bit trickier since we'll need some help from regex.
No big deal if you don't know regex, again, regex would be an entire course on its own.
So first we find all capitals and prefix them with an underscore using regex (<PHPNet fn="preg_replace" />) and
then we convert all characters to lowercase (<PHPNet fn="strtolower" />).

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Service/NameConverter.php" code={`
class NameConverter
{
    // ...

    public function convertCamelCaseToSnakeCase(string $camel): string
    {
        return strtolower(preg_replace('/[A-Z]([A-Z](?![a-z]))*/', '_$0', $camel));
    }
}
`} />

Finally, let's adapt our `deserialize` function in `AbstractRepository`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    protected function deserialize(array $data): object
    {
        $nameConverter = new NameConverter();

        $obj = new $this->entity();
        foreach ($data as $field => $value) {
            $key = $nameConverter->convertSnakeCaseToCamelCase($field);
            $obj->$key = $value;
        }
        return $obj;
    }
}
`} />

We run each `$field` through our name converter to turn it from `snake_case`, like we get it from the database,
to `camelCase`, which we want on our entity.

Now if you perform another request to `localhost` using Postman, you should see that all of our entities are filled up correctly and we
no longer have any `uninitialized` fields.

Alright. A bit of a detour. But we got there in the end! Let's get back on track and return to our other 2 `find` functions now.

## FindAll

After `find`, `findAll` is probably the easiest one to implement.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function findAll(): array
    {
        $statement = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM {$this->table}");
        $statement->execute();

        $result = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        return array_map($this->deserialize(...), $result);
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

This query returns a 2 dimensional array of all users. So we map the function `deserialize` over all items in `$result`.
If you're new to PHP8 and unfamiliar with the `func(...)` syntax, it replaces the old closure syntax. Before we had to use callables or closures:

<Snippet language="php" code={`
// callable
array_map([$this, 'deserialize'], $result);

// closure
array_map(function (array $item): object {
    return $this->deserialize($item);
}, $result);

// arrow function (PHP >7.4)
array_map(fn (array $item): object => $this->deserialize($item), $result);

// first-class callable (PHP >8.1)
array_map($this->deserialize(...), $result);
`} />

We've come a long way in PHP, but I think we can all agree that the last syntax there is the easiest to understand
and write with code completion tools.

Okay, PHP history lesson over, let's test our `findAll` function using `index.php`. And send another request to `localhost`.

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  object(Api\\Framework\\Entity\\User)#8 (5) {
    ["id"]=>
    int(1)
    ["username"]=>
    string(6) "tester"
    ["password"]=>
    string(0) ""
    ["email"]=>
    string(18) "tester@example.org"
    ["roles"]=>
    array(0) {
    }
  }
}
`} />

Awesome! We get an array of `User` objects. Try adding some more test users in your database using PHPMyAdmin,
and they will be added to the output of `findAll`.

## FindBy

Finally, the last `find` function, `findBy`. This function is the most difficult one because we'll have to dynamically create the query.
Our goal is to call `findBy` with an associative array with column/value pairs to filter out our results.
For example, `$repository->findBy(['firstName' => 'john', 'lastName' => 'doe'])` should only return records that match
those criteria.

Starting out simple, if no criteria is given, we'll return all records. Criteria can be seen as filters, so if the data isn't filtered,
all records are returned.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function findBy(array $criteria): array
    {
        if (empty($criteria)) {
            return $this->findAll();
        }
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Next up, we'll need to construct our SQL query with a `WHERE`-clause. Looping over all the `$criteria` and adding
them to the query.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function findBy(array $criteria): array
    {
        // ...
        $nameConverter = new NameConverter();

        $parameters = [];
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->table} WHERE";
        foreach ($criteria as $column => $value) {
            $key = $nameConverter->convertCamelCaseToSnakeCase($column);
            $parameters[$key] = $value;

            $sql .= " $key = :$key";
        }
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Remember from before, our database is using `snake_case` for its columns, while our entities are using `camelCase`.
So this is where our `NameConverter` comes in handy again to convert between the two.

Now all that's left to do is execute the query and deserialize the result similarly to `findAll`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function findBy(array $criteria): array
    {
        // ...
        $statement = $this->db->prepare($sql);
        $statement->execute($parameters);

        $result = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

        return array_map($this->deserialize(...), $result);
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

The complete `findBy` function should look like this:

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Repository/AbstractRepository.php" code={`
abstract class AbstractRepository
{
    // ...

    public function findBy(array $criteria): array
    {
        if (empty($criteria)) {
            return $this->findAll();
        }

        $nameConverter = new NameConverter();

        $parameters = [];
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->table} WHERE";
        foreach ($criteria as $column => $value) {
            $key = $nameConverter->convertCamelCaseToSnakeCase($column);
            $parameters[$key] = $value;

            $sql .= " $key = :$key";
        }
        $statement = $this->db->prepare($sql);
        $statement->execute($parameters);

        $result = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
        return array_map($this->deserialize(...), $result);
    }

To finalize this chapter, let's test out our work so far in `index.php`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\Domain\Repository\AuthorRepository;

$authorRepository = new AuthorRepository();

echo '### find ###' . PHP_EOL;
var_dump($authorRepository->find(1));

echo '### findAll ###' . PHP_EOL;
var_dump($authorRepository->findAll());

echo '### findBy ###' . PHP_EOL;
var_dump($authorRepository->findBy(['firstName' => 'tester']));
`} />

The output of `localhost` should now look similar to this:

<Snippet language="txt" code={`
### find ###
object(Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Author)#7 (4) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
  ["firstName"]=>
  string(6) "tester"
  ["lastName"]=>
  string(6) "author"
  ["user"]=>
  int(1)
}
### findAll ###
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  object(Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Author)#8 (4) {
    ["id"]=>
    int(1)
    ["firstName"]=>
    string(6) "tester"
    ["lastName"]=>
    string(6) "author"
    ["user"]=>
    int(1)
  }
}
### findBy ###
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  object(Api\\Domain\\Entity\\Author)#9 (4) {
    ["id"]=>
    int(1)
    ["firstName"]=>
    string(6) "tester"
    ["lastName"]=>
    string(6) "author"
    ["user"]=>
    int(1)
  }
}
`} />

And finished! That's our repositories done for now.
Later we're also going to add functions to create, update and delete items. But let's take a break
from repositories for now and move on to something else.
