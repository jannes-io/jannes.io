## Controllers

In the previous chapter we've modelled part of the HTTP protocol. Now we need something that
can process the request, and form an appropriate response. This something is what we call a controller.
Controllers are split up into different actions. And each action is responsible for taking a request, and producing a response.

Let's look at a concrete example.

The Author controller is going to be responsible for anything that has to do with Authors, and will listen to everything on `/authors`.
Then each action corresponds to a different HTTP method and parameters.

For REST, using the `Author` entity as an example, we'll need to implement the following 5 methods:
- `GET /authors`: retrieves a list of authors
- `GET /authors/:id`: retrieves a single author
- `POST /authors`: create a new author
- `PUT /author/:id`: update an existing author
- `DELETE /author/:id`: delete an author

REST specifies this very exact structure. Although each API has its own twists, for example, often PUT is replaced by POST.
Some use the singular version of the entity name, some multiple, and many more nuances...
What's most important is that your API is consistent.

### Controller abstraction

One thing that most REST APIs do share however, is using the `json` output format.
So, we're going to make an `AbstractController` which will provide some boilerplate code that can be used by all of our future controllers.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Controller/AbstractController.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Framework\\Controller;

use Api\\Framework\\Model\\HttpStatusCode;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Response;

abstract class AbstractController
{
    protected function json(mixed $data, HttpStatusCode $statusCode = HttpStatusCode::Ok): Response
    {
    }

    protected function error(string $error, HttpStatusCode $statusCode = HttpStatusCode::BadRequest): Response
    {
    }
}
`} />

This abstraction will receive some more love later, but for now we'll be providing 2 helper methods.
The first will take any type of `$data`, and return a `Response` instance from our last chapter.

The second function will take an error message, and also return a `Response`.

We also take a `HttpStatusCode`, which we default to `200 OK` for the `json` method. And `400 Bad Request` for the `error` response.

Now let's implement the methods using <PHPNet fn="json_encode" /> and setting the correct headers in our `Response`s.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Controller/AbstractController.php" code={`
<?php
abstract class AbstractController
{
    protected function json(mixed $data, HttpStatusCode $statusCode = HttpStatusCode::Ok): Response
    {
        try {
            $content = json_encode($data, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
            return new Response($content, $statusCode, ['Content-Type' => 'application/json']);
        } catch (\\JsonException $ex) {
            return new Response($ex->getMessage(), HttpStatusCode::InternalServerError);
        }
    }

    protected function error(string $error, HttpStatusCode $statusCode = HttpStatusCode::BadRequest): Response
    {
        return $this->json(['error' => $error], $statusCode);
    }
}
`} />

And there we go. We attempt to transform `$data` into a `json` string.
If it's successful, create a `Response` object with the content, the given status code, and the `Content-Type` header.
In case the `json_encode` method fails, we catch the exception and return the message with status code 500 instead.

Later on, you most likely do not want to expose raw exception messages like that through your API, and it's advisable to
replace it with a generic message while logging the actual error. But for now, we're just developing so we'd like to
see the raw error messages in our output.

For the `error` method. We simply call the `json` method, but we pass the error message in a neat array, and use a different status code.

### Implementing a controller

Let's implement this controller so we can take it for a spin. Since we've already used the `Author` entity as an example during this
chapter, we'll continue down this path and create the `AuthorController`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Controller/AuthorController.php" code={`
<?php

namespace Api\\Domain\\Controller;

use Api\\Framework\\Controller\\AbstractController;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Response;

class AuthorController extends AbstractController
{
    public function list(): Response
    {
    }

    public function get(Request $request): Response
    {
    }

    public function create(Request $request): Response
    {
    }

    public function update(Request $request): Response
    {
    }

    public function delete(Request $request): Response
    {
    }
}
`} />

As you can see, we've also already provided the 5 methods or "actions" we discussed previously.

Each action, except for `list`, takes a `Request` and returns a `Response`. This is the code equivalent of everything we've
discussed so far in this chapter.

### List action

Let's continue implementing the `list` method. As you may be able to recall, in the Repositories chapter
we implemented a `findAll` method. Let's inject the `AuthorRepository` through the constructor of this controller and
use the `findAll` method to return all authors.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Controller/AuthorController.php" code={`
<?php
// ...
use Api\\Domain\\Repository\\AuthorRepository;

class AuthorController extends AbstractController
{
    private AuthorRepository $authorRepository;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->authorRepository = new AuthorRepository();
    }

    public function list(Request $request): Response
    {
        $authors = $this->authorRepository->findAll();
        return $this->json($authors);
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Fairly easy implementation. In most REST APIs, the list action also gives to ability for a client to use
pagination. In very large domains this is even necessary. Imagine if your Twitter feed was completely fetched
in only 1 request. It'd both crash the Twitter server and your browser.

We won't be doing that now, but it's something to consider for later.

What we will be doing now, is testing our controller. Let's hop back over to our `index.php` and use our controller
to get all of our authors.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Domain\\Controller\\AuthorController;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request;

$request = Request::createFromGlobals();

$authorController = new AuthorController();
$response = $authorController->list($request);
$response->send();
`} />

If we send a request to `localhost` using Postman and everything went well, you should see a formatted
`json` document containing all of our authors.

### Get action

To finish off this chapter, we're going to implement the `get` action.

Our get action will need something from the Request, namely, which author to grab. Looking back at our structure, we're going to need
parameters in our `Request` object. A parameter is a section of the url. In case of `GET /authors/:id`, `id` would be a parameter.

Let's start off by modifying our `Request` object to store these parameters.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Framework/Request.php" code={`
class Request
{
    public function __construct(
        string $method,
        private string $path,
        private string $body = '',
        private array $parameters = [],
    ) {
        $this->method = RequestMethod::from($method);
    }

    // ...

    public function setParameter(string $key, string $value): void
    {
        $this->parameters[$key] = $value;
    }

    public function getParameter(string $key): ?string
    {
        return $this->parameters[$key] ?? null;
    }
}
`} />

We add an `array` named `$parameters` to our class. And we also provide an api to set and retrieve a parameter.

Returning back to our `get` method, we can now implement it with our extended `Request` object.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Controller/AuthorController.php" code={`
<?php
// ...
use Api\\Domain\\Repository\\AuthorRepository;

class AuthorController extends AbstractController
{
    // ...

    public function get(Request $request): Response
    {
        $id = (int)$request->getParameter('id');
        $author = $this->authorRepository->find($id);

        return $this->json($author);
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

We get the `id` from the request, and use it in our repository's `find` function to fetch the author.
Then we return the author entity in `json` format. Quite simple right?

Let's modify our `index.php` again to test it out!

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
require_once 'config.php';
require_once 'autoload.php';

use Api\\Domain\\Controller\\AuthorController;
use Api\\Framework\\Model\\Request;

$request = Request::createFromGlobals();
$request->setParameter('id', 1); // for testing purposes we manually set the id parameter

$authorController = new AuthorController();
$response = $authorController->get($request);
$response->send();
`} />

If all went well, and an author with id 1 exists, we should see a `json` representation of our author with id 1.
Let's also test what happens with an non-existing author id. Say id `12345`.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/index.php" code={`
<?php
// ...
$request->setParameter('id', 12345); // for testing purposes we manually set the id parameter
// ...
`} />

It just returns `null`. Hmm. Not really what we'd like to see. Despite `null` being valid json, we'd like to give
some more information to our client.

This is why we made that `error` function in our `AbstractController`. So let's modify our `get` function to return
a nice looking error response to the client.

<Snippet language="php" file="src/Domain/Controller/AuthorController.php" code={`
<?php
// ...
use Api\\Domain\\Repository\\AuthorRepository;

class AuthorController extends AbstractController
{
    // ...

    public function get(Request $request): Response
    {
        $id = (int)$request->getParameter('id');
        $author = $this->authorRepository->find($id);

        if ($author === null) {
            return $this->error("Author with id '$id' does not exist.", HttpStatusCode::NotFound);
        }

        return $this->json($author);
    }

    // ...
}
`} />

Now if we send another request, you can see we've got a nice error message, and the HTTP status code
reflects what went wrong. So the client now has the ability to deduct from the status code and the error
that they did something they weren't supposed to do.

So far we've constantly been updating our `index.php` to call the right controller action with the correct request parameters.
In the next chapter, we're going to dive into routing which will be the glue between an URL and a controller action.
