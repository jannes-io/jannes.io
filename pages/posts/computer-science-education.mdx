# Some issues with computer science education

Software development is a skill, there will not be any course or education that will somehow make you a master.
And if any course claims it will, they're full of shit and probably just after your money.
The only way to grow as a developer is to simply get out there and do it. Experience different projects and build applications.
Every time you make a project, you will come across different challenges and hurdles.
Every time you solve one of those challenges, you will be enriched and can look back at the solution when you encounter it again.

Writing code is often classified as a knowledge-based skill, where you need to know the syntax, you need to know the standard library,... .
While this is true to a certain extent, just knowing the standard library of a language by heart will not make you a good developer.
Let's compare programming to art. Knowing how to draw a line does not translate into a good piece of art.
However, drawing hundreds of different trees will make you substantially better at drawing trees.
The same is true for programming. Software development is a transferable/functional skill. The most important part of development is problem-solving.
The only way to get better at it is to solve many problems. Likewise for programming languages, once you master one language, it's really easy to transfer it to other languages.

## Issues with formal education in web space
Time and time again we see fresh graduates trying to enter the sector. And time and time again we see them fail a basic technical test.
Why is that? We can only speculate... . Surely someone who dedicated 3 years of their life full-time learning software development should do better?
Formal education gives a false promise of knowledge. The web's evolution is too fast for formal education to keep up.
When changing a course in formal education, it must go through so many hoops and approvals that by the time it gets into the hands of teachers, it's already outdated.

And when it does come into the hands of teachers, they need to go and research to get a better understanding of the topic.
It's not uncommon for motivated students to outpace their teachers. Additionally, there are only 2 types of software development teachers.
Those who just have a passion for teaching, and those who failed in the development industry and decided to become a teacher instead.
If you're lucky you'll get the former, they're actually doing their best to provide you with knowledge.
Teachers are simply not paid competitively compared to the industry they're teaching about. A good junior full-stack developer can already out-earn the best college teacher.

Courses are written by faculty, crafted by people who've never known the struggles and hurdles of actual software developers and who have
never even seen what a large scale production application looks like from the inside. They're not at fault for this though. Again it comes back to previously mentioned issues.

## Issues with courses and tutorials
Tutorials are simply not helpful and do not teach you anything. Say you follow a tutorial on creating a contact form,
and you're encouraged to copy/paste all the code, then you've not learnt a single thing.
We provide code examples but will never claim an example is the right solution for your use-case.

Software development is not "plug and play". The memes you see about copying stack overflow code are simply not true.
It may work for amateur projects, but any copy/pasted code will quickly be identified and shot down once you get into the industry.
Copy/Pasting is a terrible practice. You won't learn anything and despite that it may work, it's almost never the right solution to the problem you're facing.

## Conclusion
A lot of courses tackle programming as if it is just knowledge. It's not. Software development is much more comparable to art.
In art there are countless ways to express a feeling or convey a message. The same is true for programming.
There are a million ways to go from input to expected output. There is a lot of room for interpretation, creative problem-solving, code formatting & style, ...
Only practice makes perfect, no painter started with a rendition of the Mona Lisa, no sculptor started with the statue of David.
Only hard work and dedication to the craft can make you an expert.
